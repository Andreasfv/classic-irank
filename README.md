WIP

Its more of a proof of consept of what I wanted to do. There are lots to figure out, especially if there is a way to automaticaly get all the ability icons and information rather than manual input.

Super early design, but I got it to compile the best of a class and present it in a way that I technicaly only have to provide a class-id fight-id to make this work for other classes as well.

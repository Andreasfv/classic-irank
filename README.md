WIP

Its more of a proof of consept of what I wanted to do. 

Idea is to be able to get an overview of how the best players utilize their most important abilities in a more compact way than warcraftlogs.com provides for more rapid improvement/experimentation environment for myself and my raidbuddies.

Super early design, it's currently more about being able to visualize what I've compiled and if I want to make changes. The hard part is finished, it's about making the design and automating the rest of the classes and specializations left.

Data is fetched from warcraftlogs.com, icons from wowhead.com
